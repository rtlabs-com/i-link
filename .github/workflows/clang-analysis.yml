    # Run clang analyzer.

    # Detect if issues were found and upload SARIF report only in that
    # case, because reports without entries are not accepted. See
    # https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/390. The analyzer
    # is run twice in order to get a SARIF report as well as an exit
    # status when issues are detected, as the scan-build --status-bugs
    # parameter doesn't work when the output format is SARIF.
